=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Quattor qw(test_profile1 test_profile2...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Test::Quattor>

Module preparing the environment for testing Quattor code.

=head1 LOADING

When loading this module it will compile any profiles given as arguments. So,

    use Test::Quattor qw(foo);

will trigger a compilation of C<src/test/resources/foo.pan> and the
creation of a binary cache for it. The compiled profile will be stored
as C<target/test/profiles/foo.json>, while the cache will be stored in
under C<target/test/profiles/foo/>.

This binary cache may be converted in an
L<EDG::WP4::CCM::Configuration> object using the
C<get_config_for_profile> function.

=head1 INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE

=head2 Module variables

This module provides backup methods for several C<CAF> modules. They
will prevent tests from actually modifying the state of the system,
while allowing an NCM component to follow a realistic execution path.

These backups record what files are being written, what commands are
being run, and allow for inspection by a test.

This is done with several functions, see B<Redefined functions> below,
that control the following variables:

=over 4

A boolean to enable logging of each command that is run via CAF::Process.
Can also be set via the QUATTOR_TEST_LOG_CMD environment variable.

=cut

our $log_cmd = $ENV{QUATTOR_TEST_LOG_CMD};

A boolean to log each cmd that has output mocked but has no output set.
Can also be set via the QUATTOR_TEST_LOG_CMD_MISSING environment variable.

=cut

=pod

=item * C<%files_contents>

Contents of a file after it is closed. The keys of this hash are the
absolute paths to the files.

=cut

my %files_contents;

=pod

=item * C<%commands_run>

CAF::Process objects being associated to a command execution.

=cut

Desired exit status for a command. If the command is not present here,
it is assumed to succeed.

=item * C<%desired_outputs>

When we know the component will call C<CAF::Process::output> and
friends, we prepare here an output that the component will have to
deal with.

When the component may analyse the standard error of a component, we
supply it through this hash.

Optionally, initial contents for a file that should be "edited".

=head1 FUNCTIONS FOR EXTERNAL USE

The following functions are exported by default:

=item C<get_file>

Returns the object that has manipulated C<$filename>

=cut


sub get_file
{
    my ($filename) = @_;

    if (exists($files_contents{$filename})) {
        return $files_contents{$filename};
    }
    return undef;
}


=pod

=item C<set_file_contents>

For file C<$filename>, sets the initial C<$contents> the component shuold see.

=cut


sub set_file_contents
{
    my ($filename, $contents) = @_;

    $desired_file_contents{$filename} = $contents;
}


=pod

=item C<get_command>

Returns all the information recorded about the execution of C<$cmd>,
if it has been executed. This is a hash reference in which the
C<object> element is the C<CAF::Process> object itself, and the
C<method> element is the function that executed the command.

=cut


sub get_command
{
    my ($cmd) = @_;

    if (exists($commands_run{$cmd})) {
        return $commands_run{$cmd};
    }
    return undef;
}

=pod

=item C<set_command_status>

Sets the "exit status" we'll report for a given command.

=cut

sub set_command_status
{
    my ($cmd, $st) = @_;

    $command_status{$cmd} = $st;
}

=pod

=item C<set_desired_output>

Sets the standard output we'll return when the caller issues C<output>
on this command

=cut

sub set_desired_output
{
    my ($cmd, $out) = @_;

    $desired_outputs{$cmd} = $out;
}

=pod

=item C<set_desired_err>

Sets the standard error we'll receive when the caller issues
C<execute> on this command.

=cut

sub set_desired_err
{
    my ($cmd, $err) = @_;

    $desired_err{$cmd} = $err;
}

=pod

=item C<command_history_reset>

Reset the command history to empty list.

=cut

sub command_history_reset
{
    @command_history = ();
}

=pod

=item C<command_history_ok>

Given a list of commands, it checks the C<@command_history> if all commands were
called in the given order (it allows for other commands to exist inbetween).
The commands are interpreted as regular expressions.

E.g. if C<@command_history> is (x1, x2, x3) then
C<command_history_ok([x1,X3])> returns 1 (Both x1 and x3 were called and in that order,
the fact that x2 was also called but not checked is allowed.).
C<command_history_ok([x3,x2])> returns 0 (wrong order),
C<command_history_ok([x1,x4])> returns 0 (no x4 command).

=cut

sub command_history_ok
{
    my $commands = shift;

    my $lastidx = -1;
    foreach my $cmd (@$commands) {
        # start iterating from lastidx+1

        return 0 if !defined($index) or $index <= $lastidx;
        $lastidx = $index;
    };
    # in principle, when you get here, all is ok.
    # but at least 1 command should be found, so lastidx should be > -1
    return $lastidx > -1;
}

=pod

=item C<set_service_variant>

Sets the C<CAF::Service> variant to the one given in the command line:

=over

=item * C<linux_sysv>

Linux SysV, e.g, C</sbin/service foo start>

=item * C<linux_systemd>

Linux, Systemd variant.

=item * C<solaris>

Solaris and SMF variant.

=back

It defaults to C<linux_sysv>.

=cut

sub set_service_variant
{
    my $variant = shift;

    # More methods will be added as we agree on them in the
    # CAF::Service API.

=head1 BUGS

Probably many. It does quite a lot of internal black magic to make
your executions safe. Please ensure your component doesn't try to
outsmart the C<CAF> library and everything should be fine.
